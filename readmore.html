        <h2>!!Little Drops of Water Make a Mighty Ocean!!</h2>
            <p>A few thousands of schoolchildren in the state of Maharashtra, where severe water crisis has caused life-taking drought, have set an inspirational example of water conservation. Some 7000 schoolchildren in Pune are saving and conserving leftover water from their bottles in large drums at their schools. The collected leftover water is used instead of fresh water to clean school premises and water plants. Initiated by two Indian entrepreneurs Vedant Goel and Yusuf Soni, this water conservation campaign is one of the promising solutions to water crisis in India. Some Pune schools have kept buckets at their exit points, which students empty their bottles into while leaving for the day</p>
