                <h2>WATER</h2>
                <p>WATER CHANGES EVERYTHING<br>
                    Safe water doesn’t just mean people gain hours back for themselves and their families.It means
                    people live longer, healthier lives. Parents are more likely to see their children grow up.The
                    economy expands. Political unrest decreases.Families can keep their kids in school.There’s more
                    time for work, rest, and play. That’s why we’re doing everything we can to build a global movement
                    to bring water to Everyone
                    Forever.</p>

                <h2>SANITATION</h2>
                <p>A TOILET CHANGES EVERYTHING<br>
                    toilet isn’t just a nice luxury. It’s a necessity for a dignified, healthy, and safe life. Having a
                    toilet and safely managed sanitation services improves community health by eliminating preventable
                    waterborne diseases like cholera and diarrhea. And a good household toilet improves safety, since it
                    can be dangerous to find a place to go outside – especially at night, and especially for women and
                    girls.</p>

                <h2>HYGIENE</h2>
                <p>GOOD HYGIENE CHANGES EVERYTHING<br>
                    Each year, 3.5 million deaths occur from waterborne diseases.²

                    When communities have good hygiene practices alongside their new water and sanitation services,
                    those deaths can be prevented.</p>

                <h2>WOMENS AND GIRLS</h2>
                <p>WALKING FOR WATER<br>
                    The task of collecting water around the world falls heavily on women and girls. As the ones often
                    responsible for collecting water, this task can take them away from work and school.
                    When they have water, though, all that changes. They have time to work, study, and spend time with
                    their families.</p>
