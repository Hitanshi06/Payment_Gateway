        <h2>!!Where There is a Will There is a Way!!</h2>
        <p>Rural women are the most-affected victims of water scarcity in India. They spend 6 to 9 hours a day to transport 30 to 40 liters of water on their heads, ignoring its health consequences like back pain and neck injuries. But a group of 20 women in rural backwaters of Kerala is hell-bent on changing the picture. They have dug more than 100 bore well in a year to tide over water crisis in their villages. Similar is the story of the women in Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh, who dug a well in just 40 days rather than blaming their fate or nature or god for water shortage in India. When some men came forward to help them, they chose to rewrite the destiny on their own.</p>
